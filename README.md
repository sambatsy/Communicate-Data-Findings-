## Winter Olympic Medals

> The dataset is made up of 2865 records and 9 columns named (Year, Sport, Event, Country, Gender, Medal, Medal Rank, Name of Athlete or Team, and Age) Because our dataset contains many categorical variables, we will investigate the relationship for some of them. As I assessed the dataset to discover the variables, it appeared that we had Nan values in the age column; however, this Nan is for teams or pairs because the column consists of age per one athlete; no cleaning step was provided because pairs or teams are important during the analysis. dataset source: https://data.world/makeovermonday/2018w7-the-winter-olympics


## Summary of Findings

> more medals are awarded to men during the olympics, Additionally, I discovered that the youngest medalists are in their mid-teenage years (14-17), When it comes to European countries, gold medals are most common, except for Austria (bronze medals are most common there), I think some of our variables, like events (women's singles and men's singles), have equal medal distribution. 

## Key Insights for Presentation


>During the Presentation, I focused on the gender distribution categorical variable, illustrated in a pie chart, which in fact got me an interesting fact about having mixed teams or pairs during the Olympics.
Additionally, when it comes to the top 5 countries, I plotted it using Seaborn's countplot between two categorical variables, country and medal, and most of the European countries have the most gold medals there.
